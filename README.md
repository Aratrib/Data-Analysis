Client Name: Social Buzz

Background Information:
Social Buzz was founded in 2008 by two former engineers from a leading social media conglomerate—one from London and the other from San Francisco. Their shared vision was to capitalize on the foundation laid by their previous company, focusing on content as the core element of their platform. Social Buzz distinguishes itself by prioritizing content over user identity, maintaining anonymity and tracking user reactions to every piece of content. With over 100 ways for users to react, the platform ensures that trending content drives user engagement, boasting over 500 million active monthly users over the past 5 years. As a result of their rapid growth and digital focus, managing the vast amount of unstructured data generated daily—over 100,000 pieces of content including text, images, videos, and GIFs—has become a significant challenge. While Social Buzz has a predominantly technical workforce, comprising 200 out of 250 employees, they now seek external expertise for three main reasons:

Preparation for an IPO by the end of next year necessitates guidance for a smooth transition.
Managing the scale of operations has become challenging, requiring experienced support.
Desire to adopt data best practices from larger corporations to efficiently handle big data challenges.
Tasks:
For the initial 3-month project with Social Buzz, our objectives include:

Conducting an audit of their big data practices.
Providing recommendations for a successful IPO.
Analyzing content categories to identify the top 5 with the highest aggregate popularity.
